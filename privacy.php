            <p>This site uses Google Analytics, a piece of software that collects data about site visitors.</p>

            <h2>What does Google Analytics record?</h2>
            <p>What website you came from to get here. How long you stay for. What kind of computer you’re using. And quite a bit more.</p>

            <h2>Why would I want this data?</h2>
            <p>The information allows me to understand my site visitors and what content they’re reading. This allows for better decisions about design and writing. The information collected will report statistics about visitors and the types of browsers being used. No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting. All of site activity falls within the bounds of the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a>.</p>

            <p>Want to opt out of tracking?</p>
            <p>You can also <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">opt out of Google’s advertising tracking cookie</a> or <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">use a browser plugin to opt out of all Google Analytics tracking software</a>.</p>
